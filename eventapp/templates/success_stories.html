                    Through the generous donations of our supporters, we were able to build a primary school in rural Tanzania, 
                    providing education access to over 200 children who previously had to walk more than 10 miles to the nearest school.

                    The new facility includes six classrooms, a library, and clean water facilities. Local teachers have been hired, 
                    ensuring sustainable education for years to come.

                    Our urban gardening initiative has transformed vacant lots in Detroit into thriving community gardens. 
                    What started as a single garden has expanded to 15 locations throughout the city.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    These gardens now produce over 5,000 pounds of fresh produce annually, which is distributed to local families 
                    and food banks. The project has also created part-time employment for 25 community members.
